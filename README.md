# React Chat

This is a simple chat app built using React, using websockets for real-time
communication, and a Redis data store.

To start redis, just run:

```bash
$ redis-server
```

To start the javascript and css build script, run:

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

Finally to start the web server, run:

```bash
$ ./watch.sh
```
